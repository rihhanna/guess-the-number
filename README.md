# Guess the number starter


### How game works
- A number between 1 - 20 is selected by the computer and you must guess that number
- If you guess incorrectly you will be told if your guess was too high or too low and you will lose 1 point
- if you guess correctly you wil be told you are correct and the highscore will change if you got the high score.
